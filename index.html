    <H1>Welcome to the Playstation Chronicle</H1>
<p>Here we chronicle the entire library of the Sony Playstation with game information, screenshots, reviews, and insight into how these games were seen at their release. More than just a list of titles or a surface level view, we look at what influenced these games, what the context of their release was, and why they might still be important, or why they wont be remembered. Enjoy a nostalgic trip to a golden age of 32 bit awkwardness and innovation. See the dead ends, and the roads that lead to modern games.</p>
